<blockquote><em><h2>"Sharing Passion Through Beautiful Handmade Cakes, Pastries and Chocolates"</blockquote></em></h2>
	<p>From a company that started selling at farmers markets and having pop up shops all over Ireland, you could say I've come pretty far. When deciding to tone back the business to an online offering, I had to think long and hard about our customers and what they get out of our product. By selling online only, we can connect with the customer at a more personal and creative level to achieve exactly what they are looking for whether that is from our range of bespoke cupcakes, pastries or chocolates or a business looking for a branded offering for a corporate event. Other services we also provide are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="Delivery.html">Next day delivery</a></li>
		<li>Orders for corporate events</li>
		<li>Customised orders</li>
		<li>Sustainable packaging</li>

	<p>“I had 10 cupcakes delivered to a hotel in Belfast for a birthday and I couldn't have been happier. They were amazing! Thank you so much for making my friend’s birthday extra special!” <b><em>Claire S</p></b></em>

	<p>"Ordered pastries and chocolates for a work event and they were the best I've ever tasted, definitely order from Sweet Tooth again! <b><em>Nicola K</p></b></em>
